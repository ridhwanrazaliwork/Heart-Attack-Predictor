# Description
Customer segmentation is the process of grouping customers according to their interests, occupation, age, and gender into subgroups that share certain traits. In order to build a marketing plan that targets the most lucrative sectors, the company must first gather insights into the wants or preferences of its customers.

The dataset for training is around 22,000 and 9,494 for testing.
